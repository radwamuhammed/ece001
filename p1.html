<p> -It is the process of writing instructions and commands for a computer or other device; To guide him on how to manipulate the data or toperform a specific verb. The programming process follows rules for the language of his choice.</p>
<p> -Programming languages are also categorized by level
(extent of abstraction of the language) into low-level (more abstract) languages
that allow the possibility of arranging the code in templates,saving values in variables, and creating functions. 
As for high-level programming languages, the programmer can, by writing only one line,
make the computer execute a large number of commands, and programs written in low-level languages are usually faster than others.
As for high-level languages, they are considered easier and simpler. Also, programming with these languages is safer.</p>
<p> -As these languages include means of protection to prevent the programmer from harming the computer in the event of a mistake in writing some commands.
It is preferable to use low-level programming languages when writing programs that require the maximum speed.</p>
